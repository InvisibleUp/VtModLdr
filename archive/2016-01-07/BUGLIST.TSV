Date	PRIORITY	STATUS	Problem	Repro Steps	Outcome	Expected Outcome	Debugging Notes	Solution
2015-08-07	LOW	Open	Cannot load mods in NT4	"Start program in Windows NT4 SP4. Click ""Load Mod"" button."	Nothing happens	File selection dialog appears	It seems that the button's code isn't even called at all. It's really strange. Also impossible to debug quickly due to being on another OS.	
2015-08-07	VERY HIGH	Open	Random crash when loading/unloading mods	Unload and load cpufix@invisibleup 5 times.	Program crashes.	Program doesn't crash.	"Exact criteria seems to change from build to build. Don't know what root cause is. Does not seem to occur with ClrNet, for whatever that's worth."	nOPE ISSUE STILL THERE.
2015-08-07	LOW	Fixed	Program loops on I/O error during uninstall if ModUUID happens to be null.	After program crashes from bug no. 2	"Program loops, claiming there was a general I/O error in file """". Also the SQL database loses it's entry for the mod's UUID."	Mod uninstalls with no issue	Terminate program via process; closing main window causes the dialog loop to go infinitely fast. Seems to be stemming from Mod_Uninstall.	Stopped uninstallation and alerted user.
2015-08-08	MED	Fixed	SQL queries use printf instead of command injection or whatever it's called.	N/A	N/A	N/A	"I don't really want to do this, but it needs to be done if only for the basic Bobby Tables exploits. Not that a mod loader is very high-security, but still. Makes people feel better."	"Fixed after rewriting half of program. (2015-12-21, took a very very long break)"
2015-10-14	HIGH	Fixing...	Stop relying on happy paths	N/A	N/A	N/A	"When things go wrong, alert the user. Don't just truck on and hope everything is A-OK. Because it's probably not."	Added a CURRERROR variable that acts like errno.h
2015-12-21	HIGH	Open	Get a config file going.	N/A	N/A	N/A	"Specifically, don't hardcode ./games/sonicr.json. Add that fancy dialog that lets you select between games."	
2015-12-22	MED	Fixing...	Standardize and move alert strings into header	N/A	N/A	N/A	"For, like, translation and stuff."	
2015-12-22	LOW	Open	"Seperate different bits of program (UI, logic, etc.) into different files."	N/A	N/A	N/A	Helps with cross-platform stuff.
