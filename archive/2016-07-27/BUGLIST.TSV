Date	PRIORITY	STATUS	Problem	Repro Steps	Outcome	Expected Outcome	Debugging Notes	Solution
2015-08-07	LOW	Fixed	Cannot load mods in NT4	"Start program in Windows NT4 SP4. Click ""Load Mod"" button."	Nothing happens	File selection dialog appears	It seems that the button's code isn't even called at all. It's really strange. Probably due to missing API stuff in NT 4.0.	Declare WINVER 0x0400 (and _WIN32_NT and _WIN32_IE) 2016-07-02
2015-08-07	VERY HIGH	Fixed	Random crash when loading/unloading mods	Unload and load cpufix@invisibleup 5 times.	Program crashes.	Program doesn't crash.	"Big help was trying to compile it in GCC. Pointers are hard, yo. As of now Mod_FindSpace fails, which is okay I guess."	Bad implementation of Bytes2Hex causing buffer overflow AND Strcpy into strdup'd buffer AND freeing constant arguments AND you know what static analysis is cool. (Fixed 2016-01-18)
2015-08-07	LOW	Fixed	Program loops on I/O error during uninstall if ModUUID happens to be null.	After program crashes from bug no. 2	"Program loops, claiming there was a general I/O error in file """". Also the SQL database loses it's entry for the mod's UUID."	Mod uninstalls with no issue	Terminate program via process; closing main window causes the dialog loop to go infinitely fast. Seems to be stemming from Mod_Uninstall.	Stopped uninstallation and alerted user.
2015-08-08	MED	Fixed	SQL queries use printf instead of command injection or whatever it's called.	N/A	N/A	N/A	"I don't really want to do this, but it needs to be done if only for the basic Bobby Tables exploits. Not that a mod loader is very high-security, but still. Makes people feel better."	"Fixed after rewriting half of program. (2015-12-21, took a very very long break)"
2015-10-14	HIGH	Fixed	Stop relying on happy paths	N/A	N/A	N/A	"When things go wrong, alert the user. Don't just truck on and hope everything is A-OK. Because it's probably not."	Added a CURRERROR variable that acts like errno.h
2015-12-21	HIGH	Open	Get a config file going.	N/A	N/A	N/A	"Specifically, don't hardcode ./games/sonicr.json. Add that fancy dialog that lets you select between games."	
2015-12-22	MED	Fixing...	Standardize and move alert strings into header	N/A	N/A	N/A	"For, like, translation and stuff."	
2015-12-22	LOW	Open	"Seperate different bits of program (UI, logic, etc.) into different files."	N/A	N/A	N/A	Helps with cross-platform stuff.	
2016-01-18	HIGH	Fixed	Dependency Checker broken	"Install Network Free Space, then Space Monster"	Space Monster claims Network Free Space is missing	Space Monster either installs or complains about lack of free space	It's checking if the mod to install is installed. Obviously the answer is no. When'd that happen?	"Changed JSON_GetStr(root, ""UUID"") to JSON_GetStr(value, ""UUID"") (Fixed in like 15 minutes)"
2016-01-18	MED	Fixed	Dependencies not cleared on uninstall	Uninstall something with a dependency	Depedencies still exist in database	Dependencies are cleared from database	"Yeah, lack of foresight!"	Added SQL statement to delete all dependencies created by mod. (Fixed in like 5 minutes)
2016-01-18	VERY HIGH	Fixed	Add variable support	N/A	N/A	N/A		Dialog done (more or less) 2016-04-03. Kinks worked out 2016-06-20. Actually complete 2016-07-03.
2016-01-18	HIGH	Open	Add mod preview pic	N/A	N/A	N/A	This would need to be a BMP or WMF if we want it to work with GDI. Curse you 1992 standards.	
2016-01-18	LOW	Open	Add zipped mod support	N/A	N/A	N/A	We'd need to somehow find a library that lets us open a ZIP as if it was a folder. I can't say I really want to deal with that ever.	
2016-01-18	LOW	Open	Add Drag & Drop support for mod installation	N/A	N/A	N/A	"Wouldn't be hard, I don't think. Might even be easier than the button!"	
2016-01-18	VERY HIGH	Fixed	"Add the COPY, MOVE and RESERVE operations"	N/A	N/A	N/A	I hope this isn't complicated. I guess this is why I documented it. :)	"Implemented them. Missing Move, but I don't really care about that one too terribly much compared to the difficulty in implementing it. (2016-02-10)"
2016-01-20	HIGH	Open	Copy mod files on install	N/A	N/A	N/A	"That way if we need to reinstall, we have all our files."
2016-07-03	HIGH	Open	Whole file support	N/A	N/A	N/A
