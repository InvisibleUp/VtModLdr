The PE Conversion Plan (because I need to think this out now for some reason)

Things that MUST be in offset format:
	- Address given to File_WriteBytes
	- Bounds checking in Mod_GetPatchInfo

Things that MUST be in PE format:
	- Address-as-patch
	- (future) Relocation information

Things that COULD be either:
	- Space start/end address

The problem: We may (in future versions) shuffle around the PE headers. We want to combat this if possible.
             But at the same time non-PE files don't have PE offsets.

Let's always store PE space start/end address in PE format.
This *should* solve the shuffling problem (compare against the original backup?).

Check if the file is a PE, and if so, convert to File offset. Reconvert to PE for storage.
(But what if it's out of range?) In that case, store as file offset.
