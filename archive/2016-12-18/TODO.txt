X Splicer is returning space with end one lower than it should be

X Program icon still only works on Borland C++ for some reason.
	- Ah. The icon ID was defined in octal. THAT WOULD DO IT.

X Variables need a mechanism to re-write to file without reinstalling mod
	X Create a "NeedsReinstall" field in SQL. 
		(Canned, just going to base off new table)
		(If variables want both, well, they're getting reinstalled anyways. Meh.)
		Uncanned. Need it for calculations during reinstall.
	X When exiting the variable dialog... 
		X If ANY variables are modified and require reinstall, set a reinstall flag
		X Else, just do a WriteBytes to recorded position
	X On that note, make a new table for variable writeout positions
		X VarID | Start | File (pull End from variable type)
		X Make code that writes to table as well (pull from JSON)
			X When a MiniPatch is encountered, write to the SQL table.
X Add "Diff" functionality for variables (see manual)

X Split functions into files by prefix

- Clean up function definitions
	- Add Win16-style header (working on it...)
	X Make sure all functions are represented in FunctProto
	- Maybe clean up your comments? They're kind of weird

- Update documentation
	- Specifically all those notes in the /doc folder on the functions. 
	  (MERGE doesn't even exist anymore, among other things.)

X For the love of Pete, GET THIS OFF THE VM.
	- Supposedly the Visual Studio license runs out in 12 days (out of 30).
	- Windows only has 3 re-arms left (read as ~40 days)
	- Also, you know, making sure this still runs in Win2K would be nice...

- Test on Windows 95 (NOT NT 4.0!)
	- You worked hard to earn that bullet point on the back of the box.
	  Don't let your efforts go to waste.
	X ...do you even have a Win95 ISO still? (Check LappyBackup)
	  Found it!
	X Also, you know, make the VM.
	- Program works, libraries don't
		- SQLite3 will never work. ...yeah. Dammit.
	- At least tell me it works on NT 4.0

- Add WinMain -> main redirect
	- Then we can at least pretend we have support for alt. interfaces.
	X Also, rename ShowModList to, say, MainLoop

- Change RESERVE operator to have length attribute
	- (Otherwise a "reserve me anything" won't work at all!)

- Allow any numeric field to be an equation
	- You'll need to keep track of what numeric fields use which variables
