Setting up the build environment.
===

This program uses standard C89, so which compiler you use really shouldn't matter.
(For the record, I'm using Borland C++ 5.5. The *only* reason for that is Windows 95
compatibility. If you're compiling for more contemporary systems please don't use that.)

You will require the standard Windows headers. As this uses raw Win32, you do
not need MFC or .NET or anything else. The standard Windows headers are included
with all major compilers, including MinGW, Visual C++ and Borland C++.

In addition, you will need to be able to compile resource files. MinGW currently
does not have full support for resource files, so do not use that compiler.

##External Dependencies
There are three external dependencies, plus 1 additional required library.

Jansson: JSON parser (http://www.digip.org/jansson)
SQLite3: Embedded database (http://sqlite.org)
libarchive: Used as a ZIP extractor (http://libarchive.org)

libarchive depends on zlib (http://zlib.net)

##Borland C++ 5.5

For Jansson, you will need the source code and CMake.
1. Extract the source code and open the folder in the CMake GUI. Set the Binary
   location to the source directory + "/bin". Press Configure.
   When prompted for a generator, select "Borland Makefiles" with "Use Default
   Native Compilers" selected. Let it work out what the compiler is capable of.
   Click "Generate" to produce header files.
   
2. When that is done, close CMake and navigate to /bin/include. There should
   be two *.h files. Put these in the INCLUDE folder in Borland's installation
   directory.

3. In [SrModLdr source]/include/, run
   "implib -a -c -f jansson.lib jansson.dll"
   This will generate jansson.lib. Place this in the LIB folder in Borland's
   installation directory.
   
For SQLite, you will need the source code and the .DLL from the SQLite3 site.
1. Extract the source code. There should be two *.h files. Put these in the
   INCLUDE folder in Borland's installation directory.
   
2. Extract the .DLL. Run 
   "implib -a -c -f sqlite3.lib sqlite3.dll"
   This will generate sqlite3.lib. Place this in the LIB folder in Borland's
   installation directory.

For libarchive and zlib...

1. Extract the source code

2. Generate with CMake

3. Run `make install` where the Makefile was created

4. Copy built files into your compiler's install directory

   
##MS Visual Studio 6.0

This is a rather old compiler, so you'll need some work-around hacks.

Download stdint.h (a C99 standard library) from 
http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/pstdint.h. Place it in the "include" folder
in your Visual Studio install path.

(vsprintf?)

For Jansson, you will need the source code and CMake.
1. Extract the source code and open the folder in the CMake GUI. Set the Binary
   location to the source directory + "/bin". Press Configure.
   When prompted for a generator, select "Visual Studio 6" with "Use Default
   Native Compilers" selected. Let it work out what the compiler is capable of.
   
   DISABLE "USE_WINDOW_CRYPTOAPI". This will cause the library to not build.
   Click "Generate" to produce header files.
   
2. Edit /src/hashtable_seed.c and replace "SwitchToThread()" on line 260 to
   "Sleep(0)". (If you're using a newer version of Visual C++, you probably
   won't have to do this.)
   
3. Open "/bin/jansson.dsp" in Visual Studio.
   Set your Active Configuration to "BUILD_ALL - Release". Click "Rebuild All".
   With VC6, an error might appear about a missing reference to "__FUNCTION__".
   Ignore it.
   
4. Open /bin/lib/Release. Copy "jansson.lib" to your Visual Studio install
   directory.
   
5. Open /bin/include. Copy these header files to your Visual Studio install
   directory.
   
For sqlite3...
1. Extract the source code. There should be two *.h files. Put these in the
   INCLUDE folder in Visual C++'s installation directory.
   
2. Download the release DLL. Run LIB /DEF:sqlite3.def. Copy the resulting .lib
   to Visual C++'s installation directory.
   
3. Place sqlite3.dll in the folder where the Sonic R Mod Loader binary will be
   located.

For libarchive and zlib...

1. Extract the source code

2. Generate with CMake

3. Open the solution in Visual Studio as an administrator and build the "Install" project

4. Copy built files into your compiler's install directory

##MS Visual Studio 2015

Follow the instructions for Visual Studio 6, but don't edit any source code.
(There's probably nicer ways, but I'm not sure what they are.)

Also you may (will) run into errors with CMake not finding your libraries.
If this happens, you must comment the FIND_PACKAGE lines out in the CMake file.
(Or fix the makefile and send a patch to the GitHub. I'd love you forever if you did.)

If the debugger is broken, set your start-up project to SrModLdr and not ALL_BUILD.
It might also be necessary to change your working directory in the project settings to where the
DLL files and the "games" folder is located.

If it refuses to build with an error in resources.rc, remove the line
	1	RT_MANIFEST	"manifest.xml"
as Visual Studio's built-in manifest handling freaks out when a manifest is manually declared.
You don't have to worry about this with Visual Studio 2005, as the preprocessor takes care of it for you.
(It's just broken in 2015 for some reason.)
You may wish to re-add manifest.xml as a source manifest in the project options.

Can I just point out how nice Linux and even Mac OS X are for C dependencies? We don't have
to deal with this.
