\subsection{The SQL Database}
The heart of the mod loader, so to speak, is an SQLite3 database containing every mod, patch, variable, file location and space. The choice of an SQL database might seem a bit puzzling at first, but it allows for the vast power the mod loader gives. The database is split up into several tables:

\subsubsection{Mods}
This table is a list of every mod installed. It is, essentially, what you see in the Details pane of the mod loader. It contains the following columns:

\begin{description}
\item[UUID (TEXT)] A unique identifier for the mod. Does not have to be in standard UUID format.
\item[Name (TEXT)] The name of the mod. Used primarily in the user interface.
\item[Info (TEXT)] Description of the mod.	
\item[Author (TEXT)] Creator of the mod.	
\item[Version (INTEGER)] Version of the mod.
\item[Date (TEXT)] Date mod was published in ISO-8601 format.
\item[Category (TEXT)] Category of mod. See \ref{subsubsec:create-meta-cat} for possible values.
\item[Path (TEXT)] Path to stored .ZIP containing mod files.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Spaces}
A list of spaces added or removed by mods or during profile initialization. See \ref{subsec:works-spaces} for details.

\begin{description}
\item[ID (TEXT)] A unique identifier to name the space so that mod developers can refer to it.
\item[Version (INTEGER)] The revision of the given ID the space refers to. Only the highest version is considered for any given operation.
\item[Type (TEXT)] 'Add', 'Clear', 'Split' or 'New', depending on the type of space.
\item[File (INTEGER)] The file that the space refers to. Use table `Files' to convert to a path.
\item[Mod (TEXT)] The UUID of the mod that created the space.
\item[PatchID (TEXT)] The UUID of the patch that created the space.
\item[Start (INTEGER)] The first byte of the file described by the space.
\item[End (INTEGER)] The last byte of the file described by the space.
\item[Len (INTEGER)] Equal to End - Start.
\item[UsedBy (TEXT)] The mod that is currently using the space, if different than the creator.
\end{description}

For SPLIT spaces, Start and End are the IDs of the ADD/CLEAR spaces used for the head and tail of the operation. An ADD into a larger CLEAR space always creates a SPLIT space.

For NEW spaces, Start is always 0 and End is the size of the file. (Consequently, End == Len)

\subsubsection{Variables}
Contains a list of public and private variables used by mods.

\begin{description}
\item[UUID (TEXT)] A unique identifier for the variable. Does not have to be in standard UUID format.
\item[Mod (TEXT)] The UUID of the owning mod.
\item[Type (TEXT)] How the data stored in Value is represented. Possible values can be found at \ref{subsubsec:create-var-type}.
\item[PublicType (TEXT)] How the variable is displayed on the Config screen. If value is null, variable is considered "private" and not displayed on config screen. 
\item[Desc (TEXT)] Human-readable description of the variable's purpose. Displayed in config screen.	
\item[Value (INTEGER)] The number currently stored in the varaible.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{VarList}
Small table used to store list entries for public varibles with PublicType set to ``list".

\begin{description}
\item[Var (TEXT)] UUID of the variable that uses this list.
\item[Number (INTEGER)] The number associated with the value in the list.	
\item[Label (TEXT)] A description of what the entry in the list corresponds to in the mod's code or installation routine.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{VarWritePos}
If a variable's value can be altered without reinstalling the owning mod, an entry is created here with position information for any neccesary writes.

Length is determined by the variable's Type value.

\begin{description}
\item[Var {TEXT}] UUID of the variable.
\item[Start (INTEGER)] Starting address to write new value to.
\item[Len (INTEGER)] Length of the value to write in bytes.
\item[File (INTEGER)] File ID where Start is located.
\end{description}}

\subsubsection{Revert}
Holds rollback data for mod uninstallation.

\begin{description}
\item[PatchUUID (TEXT)] UUID of the patch (and consequently the space) that caused this entry to be created.
\item[Version (INTEGER)] Version of the space the revert entry refers to.
\item[OldBytes (TEXT; Hex bytes)] A hex dump of the previous contents of that part of the file.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Files}
Holds list of known files. Files are internally stored as numbers. They go up sequentially in the order that they are first referenced by a mod.  1 is always the main file and 0 is always the RAM.

\begin{description}
\item[ID (INTEGER)] Number corresponding with the path.
\item[Path (TEXT)] Location of the file relative to the main file.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Holds list of mod dependencies for uninstallation.

\begin{description}
\item[ParentUUID (TEXT)] UUID of mod with dependency.
\item[ChildUUID (TEXT)] UUID of mod that is required by ParentUUID.
\end{description}
