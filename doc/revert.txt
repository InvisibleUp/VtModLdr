HOW TO PROPERLY REVERT

Current revert:
For each patch (mod config entry) ID, we record it's ID, the bytes effected, and their new value
On uninstallation, we trawl through space (SQL DB entry) IDs and try to apply the revert data.

As it turns out, due to splitting and stuff, that doesn't work.

The simplest solution would probably be to just include the Patch ID in the space's SQL entires and, 
for each unique Patch ID encountered, do the revert. I like this.

Also we'll need to add the starting position to the REVERT table, due to spliting and stuff.
(Currently it is very, very broken. Related to that start field you just added.)
